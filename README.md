## Background
Delivery service is a form of service that provides services to deliver orders (especially goods) that ordered by customers to a place according to their
wishes. Currently, delivery service is one of the services most needed by people
in obtaining the goods needed because it saves a lot of time and energy.
Currently there are many types of businesses that have delivery services as one
of the services that can be provided to customers. One of them is a business
engaged in the food or beverage sector that has a service to deliver food ordered
to the place the customer wants.
The timeliness required in delivering food to the customer's place is the main
challenge in this service. Accuracy time in delivering the food must be shown to
keep transparency with their customers. So, by using historical data on the time
it takes to deliver food, the use of machine learning algorithms is one way to
predict the accuracy of the time needed to deliver food to location.

## Objectives
- What factors can affect the time in delivering food from the restaurant to the destination location?
- How much food delivery time prediction accuracy performance?

## Conclusions
- Rating of person in previous delivers become is the most influential factor on the delivery time of food to the destination
location. Person with the higher ratings take a less time to deliver the food than person with low ratings
- Model has RMSE score 7.28 and that means error between delivery time prediction and delivery time actual is 7.28 minutes
